# 👨‍💻 SOEP — Developer of Code, Tools, and Chaos

**Experiments in AI, utilities, automation, and all things code.**  
Welcome to my digital workshop — where ideas become tools and code gets put to work.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a developer passionate about building tools, systems, and creative solutions across multiple areas of tech.  
While I started out creating AI and gameplay systems for Unity, my work now extends far beyond that — into general-purpose programming, scripting, automation, and systems design.

I focus on **practical, performance-driven development**, from intelligent game behaviors to custom dev tools to real-world automation.  
My goal: modular, expandable, reusable projects built to solve problems — and sometimes just to have fun.

🛠️ I also tinker with hardware, 3D modeling, and fabrication to bring digital creations into the physical world.
